## Tech debt: the good, the bad and the costly

Today we take a deep dive into technical debt: what is it, when is it good, when is it terrible, how to measure it, how to cost it, how to address it.

You may have noticed I added a [new Tech Talks section](https://ismaelvelasco.dev/tech-talks) (OK, no way you noticed). It has 15 recordings from meetups, conferences and even COP26. I will periodically introduce one here.

I decided to start with my talk on Technical Debt, because I have been selected to give a 1 day workshop on the subject in November, at one of the world's leading architecture conferences, by the world's foremost software architecture certification body. It is a genuine honour. So if you enjoy the talk, you might want to sign up 
for the (virtual) workshop!

<h2>
So what is tech debt?
</h2>
Very often, tech debt is defined as a conscious trade off of quality for speed, or a result of poor design decisions. But while both of those are good examples of tech debt, tech debt can also come to absolutely top quality code: if it fails to evolve with the tech ecosystem. The cutting edge app of 2010 is very often the creaky, slow and plainful monolith of in 2020. It's not that the original choices were suboptimal: it's that time moves fast in tech, and code needs to constantly evolve to keep in sync.

Technical debt, like financial debt, can be useful, helping you enter the market and gain traction with an MVP, or allowing you to innovate, or rebuild. That's when your debt is "low interest", you understand the trade offs and the pain is in your future, with a plan to pay it back before it gets painful.

High interest debt, that's risky, and much harder to pay off. Here your technical pain is not ahead but right now, and if you're nor careful, it will compound into a debt default. Here your technical debt places serious operational and commercial constraints on the entire company, and creates existential reputational risks, from security breaches to service interruption.

This is a framework you may find useful in mapping different parts of your application:

The talk explores how to apply this framework, how to measure, monitor and prioritise your technical debt, how and when to manage, fix it or replace it, and how to make the business case for investing in addressing it.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback, as it will better prepare me for the workshop!
